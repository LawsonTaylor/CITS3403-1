This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.

## Notes

* Angular CLI
* SWAPI - The Star Wars API
* Homeworld images courtsy of a bloke who stole them from [alexandregodreau](https://www.behance.net/alexandregodreau/)
* Google fonts - Muli and Space Mono.

* Clone the repo
